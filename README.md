## Intro ##

The aim of IWI is to make tuning of Linux distribution more consistent. If you
have your own dotfiles, necessary list of package you using constantly from
distro to distro or you want to create a set of packages for specific purposes,
you can use IWI.

It's just a BASH script with extra config files looks like a list of packages
separated by sets. Dots file and settings for your beloved editors and
multiplexors.
